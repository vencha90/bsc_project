\subsection{Testing}

(10, 2100w)

How thorough was the software testing as judged from the description in the
dissertation (e.g. was the software tested for exceptions, scalability, etc.)?


\subsubsection{Automated Tests}

Test-Driven Development was introduced in Section \ref{sec:design:methodology}
The TDD process was not followed to the letter: \todo{explain why and what that
means.}

\subsubsection{User Testing}

user testing was done after software development
was completed. \todo{User testing needs to be done}

Usability and configurability - problems with limited inputs, problems with
nontransparent defaults, problems with installing dependencies


\subsubsection{Performance Testing}

Scalability, limits of software. 

Speed and efficiency: time limit, graph dimensions, price range. 

Distances are stored in memory and the expensive A* search is only used for
unknown distances. (Move to Design and architecture Section \ref{sec:design})

\subsubsection{Known Issues}

Defaults are not set transparently. Output data is inconvenient for analysis.
