How well does the implementation work? (as judged from the description in the
dissertation, and the demo)

What is the quality, sophistication and difficulty of the software (or
conceptual) implementation as judged from the description in the dissertation,
and the demo?

Is the programming (or modelling) style adequate and of good quality
(efficient, reusable, modular, clear code)?

Is the documentation in the code appropriate and useful?


\subsection{Implementation}

major system components, including main technologies

\todo{issues either here or in evaluation}


\subsubsection{Preliminaries}

automated virtualisation using vagrant, virtualbox, rvm for cross-platform
operation

Ruby, rubygems and bundler as the base

rspec and guard gems for supporting tdd. simplecov for code coverage to
identify any untested code (remark that this is no guarantee of correctness)

git for versioning


\subsubsection{User Interface}

rake and text file editing for simple user interface

runner for initialising and parsing input 


\subsubsection{The Environment}

world

Network: modelled using graphing library 'plexus'. It has not implemented an
algorithm to check for connectivity of directed graphs, therefore undirected
graphs are used.


\subsubsection{Learner}

characteristics, initialisation etc.

Q-learner algorithm


\subsubsection{Taxi}

taxi itself: characteristics, initialisation

state

action
