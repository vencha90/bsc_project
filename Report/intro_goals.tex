\subsection{Motivation}

Potential to improve public transport effectiveness

Potential to ease the work of regulatory bodies

\subsection{Goals}

Build software simulation of a public transportation market.

The simulation needs to be able to support regulated and unregulated pricing.

Public transport actions are determined by agents trying to reach some objective
e.g. maxium profit.

Compare the performance of agents working under price regulation and no price
regulation to determine whether this area is worth any further study.
