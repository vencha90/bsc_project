Taxicabs often use taximeters to calculate their fares based on route distance
and time spent travelling. However, the actual costs and potential profits are
influenced by more factors. If fare prices were set dynamically, they would
account for the actual environment and increase profitability of taxicabs.
Usage of artificial intelligence (AI) has been successfully researched in
\textcite{Tavares2012ai+routing} for traffic routing, and in
\textcite{Lou2011ai+highways} for variable pricing of toll lanes. A variable
pricing approach for public transport fares is suggested in
\textcite{Emele2013pricing+rural}. Therefore AI could be used to dynamically
price taxicab fares.
