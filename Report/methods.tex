\label{sec:design:tdd}
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a cyclic software development approach. The
cycle goes as follows: automated tests are written first, followed by writing
program code which is finally refactored. It is part of a software development
methodology called \textit{extreme programming}, first introduced by
\textcite{Beck2000xp}. An overview is given by \textcite{Copeland2001xp}.

The actual tests are discussed in more detail in Section \ref{sec:implementation:testing}.
