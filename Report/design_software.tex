\subsection{Software design}
\label{sec:design:software}

Global properties: time; Taxis
can enquire for the route from A to B at a small cost, and receive distance.
When taxis decide to go from A to B, they go at a constant speed for the
calculated time. No actions can be taken and they are marked as travelling.

Network of nodes, not known to taxi as a whole

Node has a list of neighbours and distances.
Node has a list of present passengers and taxis.

Taxi model: fixed and variable costs, has a set of actions:
getDistance(A,B),drive(A,B), askDestination(P), offerFare(P).

Passenger model: probabilistic properties with set relative weights to
calculate demand, responds to bids with Y/N.

\subsubsection{Learning}

State is based on the origin, passenger and intended destination. Actions a
taxi can take is enquiring a passenger for destination, offering a price or
driving to another place. If the passenger accepts the price, taxi drives the
passenger to the destination and receives a reward. Keeping track of the exact
passenger is not important. Each time step has a negative reward based on what
action the taxi is taking, always depending on time but also could depend on
distance travelled.
