\subsection{Design}The approach suggested by this project is not compatible with a market where fares are regulated, at least in the current form of regulation that specifies a formula to calculate fares based on some variables, usually time and distance. Other ways of regulation, for example, entry conditions, are compatible with the suggested approach and do not require any further investigation.
