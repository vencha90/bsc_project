This section formalises the simulation based on related work in Section
\ref{sec:literature} and applying the results to the context of this project.
Firstly, models for passengers and taxis are described in Section
\ref{sec:design:simulation}. Then Section \ref{sec:design:software} discusses
how these models are going to be implemented as software.
