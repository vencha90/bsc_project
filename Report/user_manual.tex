(5, 500-1000 w?)

Is the manual written in a direct and easy to understand language?

Does the manual use task-oriented descriptions (e.g. “to open a file you click
on …”)?

Are there walk-through descriptions using detailed examples (e.g. “to enter
customer Joe Bloggs with Address …”)

What is the overall structure, layout, and use of pictures (where appropriate)?
