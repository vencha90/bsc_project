(5, 500-1000 w?)

Is the manual written in a direct and easy to understand language?

Does the manual use task-oriented descriptions (e.g. “to open a file you click
on …”)?

Are there walk-through descriptions using detailed examples (e.g. “to enter
customer Joe Bloggs with Address …”)

What is the overall structure, layout, and use of pictures (where appropriate)?

Look at the 'projects' book for advice
