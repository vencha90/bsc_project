\subsubsection{Inputs}

The experiments and their analysis can be repeated by following the
instructions in User Manual in Appendix \ref{sec:user_manual}. The result
datasets can be found in the directories in the open data set mentioned in
\ref{sec:intro:openness}.

Initially a baseline of inputs were chosen without any intentional constraints
on the environmental conditions. These inputs are shown in Table
\ref{table:input_data} and the full result data can be found in
\texttt{standard} directory in the data set.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | }
  \hline
  Parameter & Value \\ \hline
  Time Limit & 1 000 000 \\
  Road network & with 6 locations, distances between 1-5 \\
  Passengers' expected fare & 20 \\
  Taxi's variable price range & 5-100 (integers) \\
  Taxi's benchmark price & 20 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{
  Simulation inputs
  \label{table:input_data}
}
\end{table}

The simulation was additionally run for control purposes, varying one input
parameter at a time. These runs are summarised in Table
\ref{table:inputs:control}, displaying the parameter in question and its
changed value, as well as the directory in the open data source where the
results are located.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{ | l | l | l | }
  \hline
  Parameter & Value & Result Directory \\ \hline
  No changes & - & \texttt{standard} \\
  Benchmark price & 15 & \texttt{lower\_benchmark} \\
  Benchmark price & 30 & \texttt{higher\_benchmark} \\
  Taxi's price range & 5 - 20 & \texttt{lower\_range} \\
  Taxi's price range & 20 - 100 & \texttt{higher\_range} \\
  Time limit & 50 000 & \texttt{limited\_time} \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{
  Control parameter changes

\end{table}


\subsubsection{Summary}

In all simulation runs, the variable pricing approach performed significantly
better. The summary results are shown in Figure \ref{figure:results:summary}.

Taxi using variable pricing earned a large profit in the simulation runs with
standard parameters, lower benchmark price and lower price range while the
fixed price taxi made large losses. The most profitable was the simulation
where the range of prices was limited to be lower than the expected price,
interestingly the fixed price taxi agent also performed better. The simulation
run with a limited time follow the same pattern but on a smaller scale
(varibale pricing 71382 profit / fixed pricing 74416 loss).

Neither pricing approach made a profit in the runs with a higher benchmark
price and a higher price range. The higher price range run was the only run
where the variable pricing agent made a considerable loss, and the profit
difference between fixed and variable pricing was smaller than in other
samples.


\subsubsection{Performance of Reinforcement Learning}
\todo{what was analysed}

Analysis of variance was performed on each simulation's dataset (meaning that
benchmark and variable pricing runs were analysed separately). Detailed
simulation analysis is included in Appendices \ref{sec:data:standard},
\ref{sec:data:higher_benchmark}, \ref{sec:data:lower_benchmark},
\ref{sec:data:higher_range}, \ref{sec:data:lower_range} and
\ref{sec:data:limited_time}. This data is organised by simulation runs as
identified in Table \ref{table:inputs:control}, and each run has two parts --
variable pricing and benchmark.

All of the simulation runs show a statistically significant (95\% confidence)
increase of rewards for variable pricing taxi agents. The increase is
approximately 0.3 for the standard run, between 0.15-0.18 for all benchmark
price and price range runs, and a surprisingly high 0.75 for the run with
limited time.

Data is less conclusive on the simulation runs with a fixed price -- only the
simulation with a higher benchmark price showed statistically significant
changes of price. Interestingly, this change was negative, meaning that the
agent actually got worse over time.
