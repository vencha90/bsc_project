unless noted otherwise, the following inputs were used
 
time limit = 1000000

graph:
  - "0, 1, 2, 4, 2, 1"
  - "1, 0, 2, 2, 3, 0"
  - "2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 3"
  - "4, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0"
  - "2, 3, 1, 1, 0, 5"
  - "1, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0"

passenger: price = 20

taxi: prices = 5..100, benchmark price = 20

Run 1: Non-regulated price much more successful with when the fixed price
equals the expected price. non regulated profit = 1000965; fixed fare loss
-1547613


run: benchmark price = 30

run: benchmark price = 15

run: prices = 5..20

run: prices = 20..100

run: time limit = 50000

\todo{process data and diagrams}

ai profitability over time, see how much time it takes for it to become
profitable etc

look at how the prices charged change over time, if at all
