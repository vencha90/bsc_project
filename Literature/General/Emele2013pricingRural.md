# overview
Agent based transport pricing. Passengers and transport providers submit requirements and bids to an intermediary agent. Passengers have hard and soft requirements, with soft requirements ordered by importance. Transport can be shared by multiple passengers. Thus transport pricing is cheaper and more people are served than with fixed pricing. 
# Strengths & Weaknesses
- Only the first soft requirement is taken in account and the rest disregarded.
