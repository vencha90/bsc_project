This paper evaluetes the taxi market in Ireland before and after deregulation in 2001. It looks at this from a legal and economical perspective. Economically the market was monopolistic and taxi licences were very expensive, consumer demand was not met and taxis could charge a premium price. After deregulation taxi numbers doubled and tripled, and consumer satisfaction increased.
